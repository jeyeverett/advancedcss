    //Media query for high resolution screens (192dpi [dots per inch] is from the apple retina screen) here if the screen has a resolution larger than 192dpi AND it wider than 600px, we use the high res photo, this is because the default photo (hero-small) is 1200px, so it would be fine for high resolution screens < 600px
    //The second condition is a rewrite of the first so it will work with safari
    //The third condition accounts for the case where the dpi is low resolution but the screen width is > 1200px, putting another coniditon into a media query after a comma acts like an OR statement
